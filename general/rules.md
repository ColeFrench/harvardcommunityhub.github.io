# Server Rules 
Listed in no order of importance. Mods and admins have the right to act on a case-by-case basis in terms of these rules and other behavior. You are expected to fully read and understand these rules in order to participate on this server. Failure to comply with these rules is bannable.

While all are welcome, this server is intended for prefrosh, students, and alumni of Harvard University. Anyone with a prefrosh, student, or alumni role is verified. This is not an admissions hub, and HCom is a **16+ server to non-affiliates**.

Please report violations by either PMing or pinging an active mod (admins and mods have Crimson names). If you’re new, please also read any channel descriptions in order to understand the purpose of the channel.

#### Rule 1 
No slurs, hate speech, or anything of the sort.

#### Rule 2
No doxxing or outing the personal information of others.

#### Rule 3 
All admissions questions must be asked in the proper channel, #prospective-students. Failure to do so will result in the removal of the messages in question. Repeated violations of this will result in a ban. This is not an admissions hub.

#### Rule 4 
You may not PM members with student role about anything related to admissions questions, homework help, or anything otherwise. Similarly, you may not ping members in order to ask them questions. Ask the questions in the appropriate channels, #prospective-students. If you ask a user in chat if you can PM them, or they say they’ll PM you, it is allowed.

#### Rule 5 
No explicit content is permitted.

#### Rule 6
No spamming or disruptive behavior of any sort.

#### Rule 7
No solicitation or advertising without prior moderator approval.

#### Rule 7
Any attempt to circumvent a temporary ban will result in a permanent ban.
