# Kindness 
Hello everyone! This document applies to any and all members of the server, so be sure to read it in depth. 

The role of a moderator is to make sure that every member of the community is flourishing. As a result, our moderation team felt it necessary that we encourage every member of our community towards kindness. Please keep the following values of our server in mind.

<hr>

#### Comfort is King 
All members should feel comfortable and welcomed in this community, especially our new members who are just learning to blend in and find their niche. Before saying or doing anything on the server, be sure to consider the comfort of those who your remarks may affect. If someone makes you uncomfortable, you are encouraged to report it to a moderator, even if it is not a violation of the rules.

#### Understand Others 
In conversations with 3+ people, messages tend to fly by. People forget the original intent or topic of a conversation. There is little time to read others' messages in full, let alone attempt to understand them in full. Take a moment to ask others clarifying questions before assuming their meaning or intent. Encourage others in the conversation to slow down and attempt to understand each other. 

#### Be Patient and Be Kind! 
Many people -- especially high school students -- come to this server uninformed or ignorant on many topics that some members of the community may be more well-informed on. Be patient. You have no obligation to educate others, but refrain from trolling or bullying others for their ignorance. If their behavior is problematic and making you uncomfortable, please report it to a moderator ASAP.

If you have any questions or concerns, PM or ping a moderator.
