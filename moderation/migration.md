# Migration
Thank you for joining me in creating a safer, more comfortable Harvard Community on Discord. Below are some instructions as we move forward with the migration. Please familiarize yourself with these policies and plans before doing anything else. 

### Sending Backups of Old Channels 
For the channels that currently exist on HCom, please refer to the Google Drive containing backups of channels and do the following: 

1. Choose a channel that exists on HCom and has a backup. 

2. Find its corresponding backup and share the file. Be sure that the sharing settings allow anyone to **view** the file and **not edit**. 

3. Send a message of the format below in the channel and pin it.

**Harvard Live Channel Backup** \
    Attached is the link to the backup for #channel-name. To view the contents of the backup, simply download the file and open it in your default browser. Do not share this link with anyone outside of the Harvard Community or with anyone who does not have access to this channel.

### Verifying Members 
As people flood into the new server, we do not want them to unnecessarily go through the whole process of reverification. Follow the setup steps below:

1. If you have not already, turn on [developer mode](https://www.howtogeek.com/714348/how-to-enable-or-disable-developer-mode-on-discord/#:~:text=In%20Discord's%20settings%20menu%2C%20select,the%20%E2%80%9CDeveloper%20Mode%E2%80%9D%20option.). 

2. Choose a unique emoji to represent you and your verifications. React to BT's message in the control hub with your unique emoji. Do not react to anyone else's. 

To verify members: 

1. Confirm that you have the list of Harvard Live members and their roles. You should receive a list of Harvard Live members in the form of a `txt` file on the morning of the migration. Download this file to your computer.

2. When a new member joins, if you want to verify them, react to their `#join-log` message with your emoji. If someone else reacts before you but around the same time, simply remove your reaction.

3. When a new member joins, right click on their @ in `#join-log` to get their ID. `CTRL+F` in the `members.txt` to find the roles associated with their ID in the file. Do not verify based on username and discriminator. Only verify on the basis of their user ID.

4. Assign affiliate roles (the roles with colors). All reaction roles and pronoun roles should be manually added by students rather than by moderators. 

5. Once you verify a new affiliate, react to their join message with a check. If they had no roles on HLive or you could not verify them, react with an X. 

If you have questions or concerns, feel free to put them in `#join-log`.
