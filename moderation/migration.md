# Migration
Thank you for joining me in creating a safer, more comfortable Harvard Community on Discord. Below are some instructions as we move forward with the migration. Please familiarize yourself with these policies and plans before doing anything else. 

### Sending Backups of Old Channels 
For the channels that currently exist on HCom, please refer to the Google Drive containing backups of channels and do the following: 

1. Choose a channel that exists on HCom and has a backup. 

2. Find its corresponding backup and share the file. Be sure that the sharing settings allow anyone to **view** the file and **not edit**. 

3. Send a message of the format below in the channel and pin it.

**Harvard Live Channel Backup** \
    Attached is the link to the backup for #channel-name. To view the contents of the backup, simply download the file and open it in your default browser. Do not share this link with anyone outside of the Harvard Community or with anyone who does not have access to this channel.

### Verifying Members 
As people flood into the new server, we do not want them to unnecessarily go through the whole process of reverification. You should have received a list of Harvard Live members in the form of a `txt` file. Please download this file to your computer and, when a new member joins, `CTRL+F` to find their user ID and roles on Harvard Live. Do not verify based on username and discriminator. Only verify on the basis of their user ID, which you can copy by [enabling developer mode](https://www.howtogeek.com/714348/how-to-enable-or-disable-developer-mode-on-discord/#:~:text=In%20Discord's%20settings%20menu%2C%20select,the%20%E2%80%9CDeveloper%20Mode%E2%80%9D%20option.) on Discord and right clicking on any user.

Only assign affiliate roles (the roles with colors), meaning all reaction roles and pronoun roles should be manually added by students rather than by moderators. 

Once you verify a new affiliate, react to their join message in order to notify other mods that they are verified.
