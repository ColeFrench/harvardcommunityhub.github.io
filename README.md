## Welcome to Harvard Community Hub

Welcome to the Harvard Community Hub website! The Harvard Community Hub was founded as an effort to connect Harvard undergraduate students, graduate students, extension school students, alumnae, faculty, and more. While our community focuses on Harvard-affiliate experience, we have made space for members of the public, who may join and, in a select few channels, interact with willing affiliates. To gain access to the private, affiliate-only channels, we have developed a strict verification process that ensures the safety and quality of affiliates' experience.

On this website, users will have access to a number of resources, community updates, and more. To ensure transparency with members of the server, we have also made all of our moderation policies and processes publicly available. 

Join the Harvard Community Hub, lovingly known to students as HCom, below!
