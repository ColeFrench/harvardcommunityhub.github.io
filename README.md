## Welcome to Harvard Community Hub

Welcome to the Harvard Community Hub website! The Harvard Community Hub was founded as an effort to connect Harvard affiliates - undergraduate students, graduate students, extension school students, alumnae, faculty, and more. While our community focuses on Harvard-affiliate experience, we have made space for members of the public, who may join and, in a select few channels, interact with willing affiliates. To gain access to the private, affiliate-only channels, we have developed a strict verification process that ensures the safety and quality of affiliates' experience.

On this website, users will have access to a number of resources, community updates, and more. To ensure transparency with members of the server, we have also made all of our moderation policies and processes publicly available. 

Join the [Harvard Community Hub](https://discord.gg/BGKAWZAGJw), lovingly known to students as HCom, now!
